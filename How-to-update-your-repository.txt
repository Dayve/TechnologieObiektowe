 -> How to update your local and github repo:

 -> Once, if not set before:
    Set the repository that will be our source:
  git remote add somebodysrepo https://github.com/jsekulowicz/TechnologieObiektowe

 -> Every time:
  git fetch somebodysrepo		Update local git data
  git pull somebodysrepo master		Update local files (this will overwrite your own files!)
  git push myreponame master		Upload changed files to your forked repo (myreponame is often called "origin")
